Imagine 100% Committed; Renewable Energy is an informational and promotional website for Renewable Energies mainly in United States cities. The website is also a catalogue of U.S. cities that have committed to 100% Renewable Energy. In the website the user can also imagine that “your town” has become a Renewable Energy committed town and model your city. Once you have modeled the city you are able to send yourself a souvenir email with general information on Renewables as well as specific information about the town you modeled. Information on any city in the catalogue can be sent to the user that is signed in. The city has Social media sharing abilities to be able to get the word out on Renewable Energy.
